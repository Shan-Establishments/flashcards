# Flashcards

This is an off-project via [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path) which I  created a flashcard-style quiz app. Users will be able to create their own topics, quizzes for those topics, and flashcards for those quizzes. Users will also be able to interact with their quizzes by flipping flashcards over.

### Technologies used 
+ HTLM
+ Javascript
+ React
+ Redux
+ npm
+ CSS

Although my code is on this page there are still  improvments needed to be made so I will make update in the near future.

# To Run

Run `npm start` in the project root and the app will be available on port 3000.

# State

The app's state is totally normalized, with slices for topics, quizzes, and cards.

# Routes

- `/new-topic` – form to create a new topic
- `/topics` – index of all topics
- `/topics/:topicId` – page for an individual topic
- `/new-quiz` – form to create a new quiz
- `/quizzes` – index of all quizzes
- `/quizzes/:quizId` – page for an individual quiz

# To Test

1. Create topics
2. Create quizzes
3. Visit the page for an individual quiz and flip the cards over

# Questions

Is this appropriately scoped? Does it have too many features? Too few?
